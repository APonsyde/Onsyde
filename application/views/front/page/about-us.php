                        <h3>Sports is more than just a game….</h3>
                        <p>But go online and all we see is banter, memes, or some Insta post of an influencer posing near a brand with #myfavouritebrand. We behave the same when discovering anything sport related online, head over to Amazon or Decathlon or watch the Last Dance on Netflix and think this is what sports is all about - cheap products, athletes with ego and pure entertainment value. At Onsyde we want to change this thinking. Why? India is on its way to become a sports powerhouse with international brands, million-dollar startups and amazing athletes bringing the best of what sports has to offer. At Onsyde, we want to be the ultimate sports guide to help you discover the best of what sports has to offer for the Indian consumer.</p>
